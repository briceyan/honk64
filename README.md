# Honk64

Honk64 is a custom encoding scheme inspired by Base64, where Base64 characters are mapped to two-character combinations of the letters H, O, N, K, h, o, n, k. The specification defines the full mapping, encoding, and decoding processes, along with a complete character mapping table. Additionally, Honk64 replaces the standard Base64 padding character (=) with a fun goose emoji (ðŸª¿).

## Honk64 Characters

The Honk64 encoding uses the following characters:

	â€¢	Uppercase: H, O, N, K
	â€¢	Lowercase: h, o, n, k

Each Base64 character is mapped to a unique two-character combination of these eight characters.

In Base64, padding is usually represented by the = character. However, in Honk64, this padding is replaced by the goose emoji (ðŸª¿).

## Honk64 Encoding Process

	1.	Base64 Encoding:
	â€¢	The input data is first encoded into Base64, which produces a string using 64 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /).
	2.	Mapping to Honk64:
	â€¢	Each Base64 character is mapped to a two-character combination of the Honk64 characters. For example, A maps to HH, B maps to HO, and so on.
	3.	Padding:
	â€¢	If the Base64 encoded string includes padding characters (=), these are replaced with the goose emoji (ðŸª¿).

Example

	â€¢	Input:
Hello, world!
	â€¢	Base64 Encoding:
SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ==
	â€¢	Honk64 Encoding:
HOHKNOHOhoNkKOhoHhðŸª¿ðŸª¿

## Honk64 Decoding Process

	1.	Mapping from Honk64 to Base64:
	â€¢	The Honk64 encoded string is divided into 2-character chunks, each chunk being mapped back to its corresponding Base64 character using the reverse of the encoding map.
	2.	Handling Padding:
	â€¢	The goose emoji (ðŸª¿) is translated back to =.
	3.	Base64 Decoding:
	â€¢	The Base64 string is decoded back into the original data.

Example

	â€¢	Honk64 Encoded Input:
HOHKNOHOhoNkKOhoHhðŸª¿ðŸª¿
	â€¢	Base64 Decoding:
SGVsbG8sIHdvcmxkIQ==
	â€¢	Original Data:
Hello, world!

## Example Code Implementation

Below is a simplified example of the Honk64 encoding and decoding implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript

function encodeHonk(data) {
  const base64Encoded = Buffer.from(data).toString("base64");
  let honk64 = "";
  for (let char of base64Encoded) {
    honk64 += b64ToHonk[char] || (char === "=" ? paddingChar : char);
  }
  return honk64;
}

function decodeHonk(honk64Encoded) {
  let base64Decoded = "";
  const padIndex = honk64Encoded.indexOf(paddingChar);
  const honkPart = padIndex === -1 ? honk64Encoded : honk64Encoded.substring(0, padIndex);

  for (let i = 0; i < honkPart.length; i += 2) {
    base64Decoded += honkToB64[honkPart.substring(i, i + 2)];
  }

  if (padIndex !== -1) {
    const padCount = honk64Encoded.length - padIndex;
    base64Decoded += "=".repeat(padCount);
  }

  return Buffer.from(base64Decoded, "base64").toString("utf-8");
}
```

## Summary

Honk64 is a playful encoding scheme that replaces Base64 characters with two-character combinations of H, O, N, K, h, o, n, k. Padding (=) is replaced by a goose emoji (ðŸª¿). The encoding and decoding processes are fully reversible and compatible with Base64 data, making Honk64 ideal for applications requiring a fun yet practical encoding method.
